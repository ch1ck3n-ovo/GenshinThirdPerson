# GenshinThirdPerson

A **Minecraft Fabric mod** that enhances third-person movement by introducing **Genshin Impact-style camera-based movement**. This mod allows for a smoother, more immersive third-person experience.

## 🌟 Features
- **Camera-Based Movement**: Move in the direction the camera is facing, rather than character-based movement.
- **Smooth Camera Clip**: When the camera is obstructed by blocks, it will smoothly zoom in.
- **Auto Character Fade**: When the camera is too close, the character will become transparent to avoid obstructing the view.
- **Configurable Interaction Recovery Delay**: After interacting with objects, movement direction remains aligned with the camera for a short period.
- **Customizable Transition Effects**: Choose between linear, smooth, ease-in, ease-out, and Genshin-like transitions.
